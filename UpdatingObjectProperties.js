/*
Updating Object Properties

After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its
properties at any time just like you would update any other
variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

Challenge:
Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name 
from Coder to Happy Coder. You can use either dot or bracket 
notation.

const myDog = {
    "name": "Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodecamp Campers"]
};

myDog["name"] = "Happy Coder";
